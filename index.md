### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite lab assignments because it was my first time working with Linux, an entirely new operating system. Before this lab, I had never run or compiled programs through terminal commands, doing so made me feel like I was more involved in the programming process. I had also never used github before and found the github workflow process to be cool, despite its limitations.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorite lab assignments because it was our first opportunity to work with a more interactive program that utilized strings. In combination with the things we learned in Lab 1, I was able to create a program that accepted my terminal input and combined them into a sentence. It was cool to see the computer take the information I gave it and then manipulate it.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite lab assignments because I found it interesting to work with command line arguments. I believe that command line arguments allow us to make more interactive programs. In this part, I got the opportunity to play around with different arguments of my own creation.
